# Curriculum Outline

This document is an outline of the curriculum; the actual taught material will be based on the notebooks found in this repository.
Those notebooks were presented at [PyCon US '23](https://youtu.be/rdyM6WDPzCY?feature=shared) and [PyCon UK '23](https://youtu.be/Sbkdf6vl6n0?feature=shared), and the contents will be merged into a single, beginner-level teaching experience for the workshop.

## Pre-requisites

We assume that the Science Oxford participants have beginner Python, and we will mention this pre-requisite on the sign-up page for other participants.

## Learning Outcomes

We envision four key learning areas, although there will be overlap.

- Python Skills
- Dataset Skills
- Geospatial Data Science Skills
- Teaching Skills

### Python Skills

All teaching will be in Python, but we will ensure that certain non-beginner topics are covered.

- Interpreted language
- Notebook vs script
- Memory access ("in-place")
- Imports and modules

### Dataset Skills:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Time-series data
- Image data and formats (PIL)
- Introductions to:
    - Extract, transform, load datasets
    - Data exploration and cleaning

### Geospatial Data Science:

- Processing satellite image data
- Coordinate conversion (pyproj and bng)
- Shapefiles / TopoJSON
- Folium / presenting on maps

### Teaching Skills:

- Construction of jupyter notebooks for teaching
- Data presentation; graphs and maps
- Accessibility in presentation and teaching
- Literate code
