# Code of Conduct

Our code of conduct is the same as that of the Python Software Foundation's Code of Conduct, available at: [https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/) with the following additions.
These additions do not supersede any of the content of that Code of Conduct, but provide details particular to our events.

## Reporting

To report violations of the Code of Conduct, or reach the conduct committee responsible for this event for any other reason, please do one of the following:

- Speak to the representatives of Rho Zeta at the event
- Email [conduct@rhozeta.io](mailto:conduct@rhozeta.io)

If you report an incident in-person then that team member is responsible for writing up a report once any urgent action has been resolved.
If you are reporting over email we encourage, but do not require, you to check the [Procedure For Reporting Code of Conduct Incidents](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/reporting/) page for a list of the details that will help us handle the report quickly.

Problems that arise during the course of the event should be addressed using these channels.
Any problems that members find with this committee or process should then be escalated to the PSF Code of Conduct Work Group at [conduct-wg@python.org](conduct-wg@python.org).

## Enforcement

As noted in the code of conduct, community members asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. 
Failure to comply will result in the member being asked to leave the event. Failure to leave the event would then become a matter for the on-site security and staff.

If a representative or organiser deems a member's continued presence to be an unreasonably high risk for future inappropriate behaviour,
for example if a violation of the code of conduct is extremely severe or the community member does not display
an awareness of how to avoid future violations, then the member will be asked to leave.
