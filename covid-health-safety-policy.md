# COVID/Health & Safety Policy

Whilst there are no COVID-19 restrictions in the UK (see [UK Government guidance and support](https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus)), workshop participants are required to have received a minimum of two doses COVID-19 vaccinations at least 3 weeks prior to the workshop date.    
    
A portable air filter (Smart Air QT3 Portable Air Purifier) with a HEPA filter that removes 95% of particles,including COVID-19, will be continuously activated in the classroom where the workshop is being held on the Science Oxford site.    
    
Participants are encouraged to wear a high grade mask, such as FFP2 or FFP3, particularly when visiting other indoor locations outside the filtered classroom on the Science Oxford site.     
    
Participants who are confirmed COVID-19-positive and/or present strong signs of associated symptoms on the day of or in the immediate period leading up to the workshop are required to cancel their space on the workshop asap, by informing the organisers at [info@rhozheta.io](mailto:info@rhozheta.io).
This will best enable the organisers to re-allocate last-minute slots to potential participants, e.g. on a waiting list.
